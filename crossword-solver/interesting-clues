(0,("tough to get the first meadow grass cut",8),"leathery") -- badly formed(?)
yet the solver has an alternative (better?) explanation!
I think the solution is "LEATHERY"

Let me explain...
I think the answer is supposed to mean "tough to"
"get" separates the definition from the wordplay
I think "cut" indicates the insertion of one word into another
   1: "the" is verbatim text
   2: I think "first" indicates a first-letters take-out
         I think we have the concatenation of 2 sub-clues:
            1: The text "meadow" resolves to "lea"
            2: The text "grass" resolves to "rye"
         Joining the results together we get "lea rye"
      The result of the take-out is "leary"
For the insertion, "the" needs to be inserted into "leary"
The result is "leathery"
