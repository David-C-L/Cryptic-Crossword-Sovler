To run in GHCi:

% ghci Solver

Then, e.g.

*Solver> clue 45
("Peeling paint, profit slack, upset, in a state",10)
*Solver> solve (clue 45)
0 765
1 765
a state -> CALIFORNIA(reversal[upset in] AINROFILAC(middle letters[peeling] PAINT PROFIT SLACK(paint + profit + slack)))

Or you can call the parser (Parser.hs) and evaluator (Evaluation.hs) directly.
Explain.hs and RunBenchmarks.hs do this.
